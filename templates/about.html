                        Welcome to the Durban Tabletop Club! Based in Durban, South Africa, we're a Warhammer-focused community of 
                        players and hobbyists. We run a few local leagues and organise hobby-related events in addition to playing 
                        a variety of different wargames.  You can learn a bit about the history of the club below, and you'll find 
                        several helpful links around the site!

                        The Durban Tabletop Club (DTC), formerly known as the Durban War Games Club (DWGC), 
                        has been around for many years under several different names. From the, 'Durban Miniature Wargames club' 
                        to 'Durban Area Wargamers' and 'Westville Historical Military Modelling Society' (WHAMM) which regularly 
                        met at the Westville Library in Durban.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each club name representing the same hobby club, initiated by different folks who have played their part in 
                        the club's history and have been instrumental in its history, these revered "veteran" gamers still roll their
                         dice in defiance of the odds today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         When the club was officially constituted is lost in the vagaries of time, however, to paraphrase and borrow 
                         a quote, "a wargames club needs two people and two armies". With this in mind Noel Zaal can attest that the 
                         first wargame in Durban was played as early as 1969, making DWGC arguably the oldest wargames club in SA (at 
                         least until someone proves otherwise).

                        In his personal account Shawn Comrie (a co-founder of the Bluff Chess Club) writes that in late 1975 while
                         browsing through Adam's Bookstore, "amongst the thousands of books at Adam's shelves, I chanced upon a book, 
                         "The War game" by Terence Wise (Which I still have). Inside was a small note from Noel Zaal advertising his 
                         war games club in Durban." This clever piece of marketing at the target audience is what drew people to the 
                         hobby along with the friendly atmosphere, a genuine love of war gaming, history and fun that is present in the club.

                        Another mentionable name is that of Grant McKenna, who joined the war gaming scene in Davenport after reading
                         about war gamming in a newspaper article in 1977. Later he ran a group from the Wizards Bookstore in Windermere 
                         Centre, demonstrating Warhammer Fantasy and 40k games for them in the early 2000's. The bookstore sponsored
                          tournaments and benefitted from the sales driven by new converts and enthusiast.

                        An enterprising and young Andrew Martins bought distributer rights from Games Workshop and sold models from 
                        his newly formed gaming store, Blaze Gaming, ran from his mother's garage in Avondale Road, right across from
                         Greyville racecourse, where he also hosted regular games session on Thursdays. He held painting workshops and 
                         terrain building days; one club member recalls building the hall of Meduseld (from LoTR) right out of the White 
                         Dwarf article. Around 2002 Andrew joined forces with "Eric's Hobby Specialist" store in Kensington Durban North, 
                         where Eric hosted our gaming space. Attendance and stock grew dramatically. Unfortunately, when Eric moved his 
                         shop to Gateway we had to find a new venue.

                    <p>
                        In 2005 the Warhammer players and the Historical players formally joined forces to fall under one club name with a
                         purpose of growing the war gaming scene in Durban, however, the two groups of players split again some years later.

                        The early 2020s saw the tenure of Darryn as Chair of the club. This period saw tremendous growth, as Darryn poured 
                        tons of energy into the club. Tournaments and events really took off, and there was a huge drive to encourage other 
                        aspects of the hobby, such as miniature painting, which culminated in the introduction of the Golden Brush competition!
